## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fluid typography and spacing
- Accessible

### What I learned

- [`<details>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) and [`<summary>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary) - Wow! What an amazing solution. When looking around for CSS only, accessible accordion solutions it seems easy to go down a rabbit hole and start looking at ideas related to the use of [`:target`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target) or ... But [Exclusive accordions using the HTML details element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/html-details-exclusive-accordions/) is the semantically-appropriate, even if less well known, solution for this. And using `<details>` makes the implementation so much easier. See also:

  - [How to build a CSS-only accordion](https://verpex.com/blog/website-tips/how-to-build-a-css-only-accordion)
- [Can I change the height of an image in CSS :before/:after pseudo-elements?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8977957/can-i-change-the-height-of-an-image-in-css-before-after-pseudo-elements) - I had to spend a little time trying to make sure the icons before the FAQ heading and in each FAQ summary were sized appropriately (and resized as well).
- [CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors) - Continuing to learn about and get comfortable with the different CSS selectors. I make use of the `:not` and `:first-child` selectors so that the first summary element doesn't have a top border. And I spent more time with [`:has` selector](https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/previous-sibling-css-has/) when I was trying to make a solution from `:target`, but didn't have a need for that in the current easier solution.
- [`background`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) - Also still trying learn and get comfortable with the `background` shorthand. I find it hard to read the specifications and know what order each of the properties go in and what's required and things like that. Hopefully, with more experience, I will get better at reading the specifications and deciphering them.

### Continued development

Specific areas that the solution should be improved (known issues):

- I definitely think there is work to do on deciding when to transition from the background pattern for the mobile view versus the desktop view. Right now, the mobile view pattern probably is staying too long, so I should think about lowering the media query (it's currently at 750px).
- Had some errors in the HTML validator report that I need to address. The error was "Attribute "name" not allowed on element "details" at this point. `<details name="faq">`". The error shows up for all 4 of the `details` elements in my HTML document. But I don't fully understand what is wrong with adding the "name" attribute to that element given that [it is clearly a part of the specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details#name). Although maybe the [caniuse for this element](https://caniuse.com/details) is not at a sufficient level of adoption? Seems good to me. So not sure what to do, and I will have to look into it a bit more. I could potentially get rid of the "name" attribute and instead [insert a bit of JavaScript code like is done in this example](https://verpex.com/blog/website-tips/how-to-build-a-css-only-accordion). But then it wouldn't be CSS only, right?
- Consider overriding the `:marker` pseudo element that comes along with the `summary` element for inserting in the new icon, rather than building in a new `::after` element. Why not take advantage of the built-in elements as much as possible, right?

More general ideas I want to consider:

- Hmm ðŸ¤” ...
